              Set up our breeds:
                - fires: burns trees and turns into embers.
                - embers: decay overtime and eventualy turns into "ashes".
                - trees: the only type of patch besides de the default one. When it burns it changes color (ashes)

              Set up options for our simulation:
                - density: percentaje of patches that will be trees
                - ember_decay_rate: rate at which an ember decays and eventually transforms into ash. 
                    1 is inmediately, 0 is never. The lower this number is the more embers there will 
                    be at any given time, and thus, the slower the simulation will be.
