# ### Agents

# Class Agents is a subclass of AgentSet which stores instances of Agent or
# Breeds, which are subclasses of Agent
class Agents extends AgentSet
  # Constructor creates the empty AgentSet instance and installs
  # the agentClass (breed) variable shared by all the Agents in this set.
  constructor: -> # agentClass, name, mainSet
    super # call super with all the args I was called with
    @useSprites = false

  # Have agents cache the links with them as a node.
  # Optimizes Agent a.myLinks method. Call before any agents created.
  cacheLinks: -> @agentClass::cacheLinks = true # all agents, not individual breeds

  # Use sprites rather than drawing
  setUseSprites: (@useSprites=true) ->

  # Filter to return all instances of this breed.  Note: if used by
  # the mainSet, returns just the agents that are not subclassed breeds.
  in: (array) -> @asSet (o for o in array when o.breed is @)

  # Factory: create num new agents stored in this agentset.The optional init
  # proc is called on the new agent after inserting in its agentSet.
  create: (num, init = ->) -> # returns array of new agents too
    ((o) -> init(o); o) @add new @agentClass for i in [1..num] by 1 # too tricky?

  # Remove all agents from set via agent.die()
  # Note call in reverse order to optimize list restructuring.
  clear: -> @last().die() while @any(); null # tricky, each die modifies list

  # Return an agentset of agents within the patch array
  inPatches: (patches) ->
